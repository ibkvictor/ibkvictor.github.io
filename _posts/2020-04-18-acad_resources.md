### A compilation of resources I found useful while learning new topics.

I have listed them in the order I used it. Will keep on updating as and when I remember the resources I used.


## Contents
* Probabilty, Statistics and Information Theory
* Graph Neural Networks
* Reinforcement Learning
* Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning

## Probabilty, Statistics and Information Theory
