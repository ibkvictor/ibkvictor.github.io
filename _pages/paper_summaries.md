## One page summaries of papers I found interesting along with ideas to extend them!

#### Reasons for writing paper summaries:
* Writing paper summaries helps me in retaining the information in the paper and understanding it in a better way as it makes me think more about the paper which I would not have done by just reading the papers.
* Helps me think about possible extensions of the paper by connecting information in the previously read papers and trying to combine the positives of all the papers.
* Motivates me to read more papers!

#### Disclaimer:
The paper summaries contains ideas which I could think of when I read the paper. The ideas/extensions may or may not work. They are just to make me think more about the paper. I do not intend to insult or degrade any of the authors' work.
